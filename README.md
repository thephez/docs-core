Dash Core Documentation

information to help you start working with Dash as quickly as possible. This
core developer documentation is available at
https://docs.dash.org/projects/core, while user documentation is maintained at
https://docs.dash.org/ and Platform developer documentation at
https://docs.dash.org/projects/platform.
