## Check documentation against Core help output

Compare this documentation
```
INSERT MARKDOWN TABLE FROM DOCS HERE
```

With the actual help output
```
INSERT "HELP <RPCNAME>" OUTPUT HERE
```

Only list any discrepancies and output markdown table entries in a copyable code block for items missing from the documentation

## Remove the excess whitespace at the end of tables

Remove the whitespace padding from the last column of this markdown table. do not worry about alignment of the end of the line but do include the ending "|" with a single space before it
