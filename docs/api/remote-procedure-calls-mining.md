## GetNetworkHashPS

The [`getnetworkhashps` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-mining.md#getnetworkhashps) returns the estimated network hashes per second based on the last n blocks.

--- | --- | --- | ---
`height` | number (int) | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | The height of the last block to use for calculating the average.  Defaults to `-1` for the highest-height block on the local best block chain.  If the specified height is higher than the highest block on the local best block chain, it will be interpreted the same as `-1`

*Result---estimated hashes per second*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The estimated number of hashes per second based on the parameters provided.

Get the average hashes per second for all the blocks since the last
difficulty change before block 6000.

## PrioritiseTransaction

The [`prioritisetransaction` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-mining.md#prioritisetransaction) adds virtual priority or fee to a transaction, allowing it to be accepted into blocks mined by this node (or miners which use this node) with a lower priority or fee. (It can also remove virtual priority or fee, requiring the transaction have a higher priority or fee to be accepted into a locally-mined block.)

No change is made to the actual fee paid by the transaction

*Result---`true` if the priority is changed*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | bool (true only) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Always set to `true` if all three parameters are provided.  Will not return an error if the TXID is not in the memory pool.  If fewer or more than three arguments are provided, or if something goes wrong, will be set to `null`

* [GetBlockTemplate](../api/remote-procedure-calls-mining.md#getblocktemplate): gets a block template or proposal for use with mining software.

## SubmitBlock

The [`submitblock` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-mining.md#submitblock) accepts a block, verifies it is a valid addition to the block chain, and broadcasts it to the network. Extra parameters are ignored by Dash Core but may be used by mining pools or other programs.

*Parameter #1---the new block in serialized block format as hex*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
